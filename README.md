# Prediction of molecular NMR chemical shifts via three-dimensional graph neural networks

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a three-dimensional graph neural network (3D-GNN) for predicting molecular NMR chemical shifts. The 3D-GNN will be trained on a dataset of 3D molecular structures and their corresponding NMR chemical shifts. The 3D-GNN will be able to predict the chemical shifts of unseen 3D structures. The 3D-GNN will be evaluated on the accuracy of its predictions and the computational efficiency of its training and inference.
