# Prediction of molecular NMR chemical shifts via three-dimensional graph neural networks and transformer-based models


## Introduction

In this project, we aim to develop a three-dimensional graph neural network (3D-GNN) and a transformer-based model for predicting molecular NMR chemical shifts. The 3D-GNN is a deep learning model that can capture the spatial and temporal dependencies of the chemical shift data. The transformer-based model is a powerful model that can capture the contextual dependencies of the chemical shift data.
